Menu item information split up into different elements
    i.e. the price for slab sandwiches is split up with currency
    in a separate span
    This causes the algo to include that span in the top 3, so it has the $
    instead of the number

Some menus appear to not even have a price, need to handle that

Slab menu has price top and price bottom :(, we need to somehow pick just 1

Not every menu item name has a description, so if we just try to line up 
the lists it wont work

If we allow for more than 3 in topN, then we get other text items like
restaurant about description, address, etc. These can have more chars than the
average length of say, the menu item name, and so it will get incorrectly 
identified as the name

Take into account proximity to other candidates?

Candidates can be identified by : 
    having frequent occurances
    having numbers or food words

Can we instead of directly getting the keys, identify the "Structure"
and then find that structure repeated and from that common structure pull out
the menu items

Focus on menu item name and build from there

Calculate distance using (X,Y)
